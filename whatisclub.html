  <p>This club was created for anyone who was ever interested in participating in a League of Legends tournament. People who strive to become the best and want to win are the people who join our club. That's why we want YOU to join our club as well because we believe that anyone who has clicked on our website has played League of Legends or is still playing League of Legends and wanted to see what our club is all about. We offer countless opportunities for players to go pro and join the big leagues with all the professional players throughout the world. The LCS (a.k.a The League of Legends Championship Series) is the name of two professional League of Legends eSports leagues run by Riot Games. Twenty teams compete in two separate competitions in Europe and North America, with ten teams per continent. Each annual season of play is divided into two splits, spring and summer and conclude with play-off tournaments between the top six teams from each region respectively. At the end of the season, the winner of the summer split, the team with the most championship points, and the winner of the gauntlet tournament in each league qualify for the annual League of Legends World Championship. The LCS pros watch our tournaments to find new players to put in their teams and each year at least 4-5 players are selected to join the LCS. We want you to make your mark and join us for a head start on going pro.</p></center></div>

        <p> Hey everyone! I am a 24 year old with a dream of creating a club where young adults and teens can express their love for the best game in the world (league of legends c: ) and take a break from school or work. When I was growing up I really enjoyed playing league of legends but I could never find a club where I could join and compete to verse other teams and play semi-professionaly. However, as I got older, I believed I could create a system where it could work out. So that's why I created this club and look forward to see how it could turn out in the future. </p></div>
