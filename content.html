  <p>League of Legends is a fast-paced, competitive online game that blends the speed and intensity of an RTS with RPG elements. Two teams of powerful champions, each with a unique design and playstyle, battle head-to-head across multiple battlefields and game modes. With an ever-expanding roster of champions, frequent updates and a thriving tournament scene, League of Legends offers endless replayability for players of every skill level.</p></center></div>

    <div class="why">
    <center><p>So maybe you’ve been branching out and have been looking for a new gaming experience. Perhaps you’ve grown tired of the bickering console wars or are exhausted by the endless release of games combo’d with Mt. Dew and Doritos. Possibly you’re feeling adventurous and “New” is all you care about when it comes to games and if that’s the case then there is something we think you should know: the world’s most popular video game, League of Legends, is entering its  fifth year of mainstream gaming and there’s never been a better time to jump in! League of Legends is the world’s most popular MOBA, boasting 67 million players monthly and up to 30 million players each and every day across its global servers it is disputably the most popular game in existence. In this MOBA, you play as one of 121 characters (referred to as Champions) in teams of five fighting others in a race down their lanes to destroy the enemy base first. Ideally, teams will send one player to the top lane, one to the middle lane, two into the bottom lane and the fifth one will take the jungle that separates these lanes. Every lane will fight individually while receiving aid from their jungler until it becomes time for 5 on 5 team fights! Since the game stems from the ideals of World of Warcraft and other online games before it, there are diverse sets of roles and characters who fulfill them. What’s your play style? Are you a support, acting as a medic for the easy-to-kill champions? Or maybe “No guts, no glory” is your anthem and prefer to get right up in the face of your enemies with a Tank or Bruiser!  However you play your games, League of Legends has something to suit you.</p></center></div>
